# personal-lineageos-flashkit-
This kit will help you get Lineageos onto any android device using a PC, and a USB cable. THIS IS UNOFFICIAL
I will be using the canadian S8 plus

# 1. PC Tools (download these now)
Samsung USB Drivers
Needed so your PC recognizes the phone in Download Mode.

Search for:
Samsung USB Driver for Mobile Phones (latest version)

Install it on your PC.

# Odin (Windows flashing tool)
Use a stable version:

Search for:
Odin3 v3.13.1

Download the ZIP → extract it → keep Odin.exe  ready.

# 2. TWRP for SM‑G955W (S8+)
Your model uses the same TWRP as the Exynos S8+.

Search for:
TWRP 3.7.0_9-0 for dream2lte (Galaxy S8+) .tar

Make sure the file ends in .tar — that’s the one Odin can flash.

Save it in your S8+ folder.

# 3. LineageOS ROM (choose one)
You have two options depending on what you want:

Option A — Official LineageOS (recommended)
Search for:
LineageOS 20.0 dream2lte download

Download the .zip file.

Option B — Unofficial LineageOS 21 (Android 14)
If you want the newest Android version, search for:
LineageOS 21 dream2lte unofficial

Download the .zip.

Either one works on SM‑G955W.

# 4. GApps (optional, only if you want Google Play)
If you want Google apps, choose one package:

Search for:
MindTheGapps 13.0 (for LineageOS 20)
or
MindTheGapps 14.0 (for LineageOS 21)

Download the .zip.

Pick the smallest package unless you want full Google services.

# 5. Magisk (optional, only if you want root)
Search for:
Magisk v27.0 zip

Download the .zip.


# notes

This guide will only work for the S8 plus, If you wish to do this on another android phone, install a different version of TWRP.
